# Check Out My First Project: WeatherApp

I'm excited to share my first project with you! WeatherApp is a web application that provides real-time weather updates based on your current location or any city you manually search. It features:

- **Automatic Location Detection:** Fetches weather information for your current location.
- **Manual Search:** Allows you to search for weather updates in any city.
- **Real-Time Data:** Retrieves the latest weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

You can try out the live version of WeatherApp [here](https://keshabkjha.github.io/WeatherApp/).

Feel free to check out the project on GitHub for more details or to contribute:

Thank you for your support and interest!
